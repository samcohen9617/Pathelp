                THE CONDOR STREET SUBSTATION <br />

                In 2014, local energy provider Eversource proposed building a high
                voltage electrical substation. Part of a larger electrical transmission project, the substation was put forth by Eversource as a “needed piece of
                critical infrastructure.” Of much concern to the community was the suggested placement of the substation across the street from an existing
                playground, on city-owned land originally slated for a soccer field.
                <br /><br />
                “CRITICAL” INFRASTRUCTURE<br />

                Electric demand is growing in eastern Massachusetts. The area
                needs an additional substation and transmission capacity to support the
                reliable delivery of electric power to meet the region’s current demand.
                This is contrary according to what New England’s report of Capacity,
                Energy, Loads, and Transmission Report claims is going to happen, in
                part due to a wider adoption of off-grid energy solutions.
              <br />
              <br />

              THE ISSUE IS THE SITE<br />
“We didn’t look at a lot of other areas because we had the available land”
“Are we saying it’s perfect? There’s no perfect location”
- Eversource’s Bob Clark, Director of Siting and Project Outreach <br /> <br />
THE SITE WILL FLOOD<br />
“None of their flood risk modeling takes into account the role of storm
water flooding due to intense rain and backed-up sewers.”
-Marcos Luna, Resident and Geology Professor
              </div>
            <div class="collapsibleDiv" id="collapsibleDiv3"> COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS
              <br />
                “The East Boston population is 53% Latinx, with 17% of residents living below the poverty line. Over the years the immigrant faces of “Eastie” have changed from Jewish, Canadian, Irish, and Italian, to Colombian,
                Salvadoran, and Middle Eastern. East Boston has proudly identified as an
                immigrant neighborhood that has served as a “gateway community” for
                many families”<br /><br />
                “People of color make up more than 60% of the population, greater
                than 45% of the population are immigrants, which has led to the state designating the neighborhood as an Environmental Justice Population” <br /><br />
                “While the various waves of immigrants have been diverse in language
                and culture, until recently, they were unified in their working-class status.
                The newest arrivals to the neighborhood do not share this background, as
                they purchase newly renovated condominiums that were once rental tenement apartments.”

              <br />
              <br />
              FURTHER DIVIDING THIS CULTURAL LANDSCAPE<br />
“During a decisive November 2017 hearing, the board did not provide two-way
interpretation services in Spanish or Portuguese, spoken by Eastie’s Brazilian immigrants, or, for that matter, any other language. Although siting board members were
able to hear the English interpretation of Spanish testimony from community members,
community members were not provided with an interpretation of the meeting’s proceedings, which were in English”
<br />- Orion Magazine’s Unjust Legacy<br /><br />
“You take a low-income neighborhood, and someone comes in and says we’re
going to put in this dicey sort of substation. These are the kinds of things that benefit
the region as a whole, and yet the burden that they represent is only held by a certain
community”<br />
- Resident and Greenpeace Organizer John Walkey<br /><br />
“This electrical substation: that’s the ugliest thing I’ve seen yet on the screen. Putting it there, it’s like putting liverwurst in an Italian cannoli.”
<br />- Resident Fran Ippolito Riley<br /><br />
LETTER TO KATHLEEN THEOHARIDES<br />
(Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary)<br />
“For far too long, black, brown, and immigrant communities have been
excluded from the decision-making processes that directly affect their
quality of life. We must address the inequities that intersect race, class,
and public health, and that begins with ensuring that the residents of East
Boston have a full say in the evolution of their neighborhood”...<br />

                      UINSURPRISING BUT STILL SHOCKING<br />
                      After years of opposition, the EFSB gave approval to the substation.
                      The unanimous vote came after 20+ hours of public meetings during
                      which high-profile elected officials, and more than 50 community members atttended after multiple delays due to the blizzards at the time.
                      Holding it [then was] “just such a slap in the face considering the moment
                      that we’re in, this reckoning this country is in both environmentally and in
                      terms of civil rights,”<br />
                      - Boston City Councilor Lydia Edwards<br /><br />
                      FIGHTING THE LAW ... WITH THE LAW?<br />
                      The board failed to consider “local alternatives that would have advanced clean energy and reduced carbon emissions, including residential solar power and energy storage.”
                      “East Boston already bears a disproportionate burden of industrial infrastructure and the associated environmental and health risks, and
                      today’s decision will only increase that,” she said in a statement. “We
                      must chart a new course where communities can meaningfully
                      participate in EFSB proceedings and where energy and environmental
                      justice are central to decision-making.”<br />
                      -Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey<br /><br />
                      WHAT NEXT?<br />
                      “The more they do things like this, the more people feel like they never
                      had a chance to begin with. And when people check out of the process,
                      they check out of, I think, really, honestly fighting for their neighborhood.”
                      If the parties fail to come to an agreement by the end of July
                      2021, Eversource may proceed with construction anyways.
                      At its Wednesday (2/24/21) meeting, the Boston City Council
                      discussed a citizen petition for a nonbinding ballot measure that would
                      ask voters if they support relocating the planned substation, such as to
                      Logan Airport.

              <div class="collapsibleDiv" id="collapsibleDiv6"> My goal is to identify a mutually agreed upon framework between industry members, community members, and government officials for the
                  future of the Condor Street Site. <br /><br />
                  I believe in enabling community power with local infrastructure as a
                  counter to Eversource’s regional power and private infrastructure. East
                  Boston has shown it can handle co-existence with heavy industry, but to
                  completely ignore the will of the residents and elected officials cannot
                  be tolerated.<br /><br />
                  I wish to transcend language barriers, cultural differences, and material resources towards an inclusively and equitably powered future that
                  both powers, and empowers, the communities in which these projects
                  will exist.</div>
